// There are n pirates.

// Each pirate ranks by seniority: Pirate 1 is the boss, Pirate 2 below him, etc.

// The boss proposes a distribution of coins.

// All pirates (including the boss) vote: yes or no.

// If at least 50% agree, the proposal is accepted. Otherwise, the boss is killed, and the next pirate becomes the new boss.

// Pirates are rational:

// They prefer survival over death.

// They prefer more coins over fewer.

// If coins are equal, they prefer to kill the boss (because theyâ€™re bloodthirsty ðŸ˜ˆ).
